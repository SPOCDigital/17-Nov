VIDEO PLAYER WEBSITE OVERLAY - INSTRUCTIONS
=============================================

OVERVIEW:
---------
Your website now shows a video player website (like YouTube) before the Windows warning page.
Users will see a professional video player interface with a main video and sidebar thumbnails.

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
1. Page loads → Video player website appears
2. Main video plays automatically (muted, as per your request)
3. Sidebar shows 9 random video thumbnails from your collection
4. Users can click thumbnails to switch videos in the main player
5. Hovering over thumbnails previews that video
6. Clicking "Continue" button → Closes video player and shows Windows warning page

VIDEO FILES SETUP:
------------------
CURRENTLY USING HOSTED VIDEOS:
The system is now configured to use 10 videos hosted at:
https://videosforresearch14102025.pages.dev/v1.mp4 through v10.mp4

These are external videos loaded from the cloud, NOT from the overlay folder.

If you want to change the video source:
1. Open win/script.js
2. Find line 474: const VIDEO_COUNT = 10;
3. Find line 475: const VIDEO_BASE_URL = 'https://videosforresearch14102025.pages.dev/';
4. Update the URL or video count as needed

To switch back to LOCAL videos:
1. Change VIDEO_BASE_URL to: 'overlay/'
2. Place your videos in win/overlay/ folder named v1.mp4, v2.mp4, etc.

The system will:
- Randomly select one for the main player
- Display the others randomly in the sidebar
- Automatically try the next video if one fails to load
- Show a loading spinner while video is loading

CUSTOMIZATION:
--------------
1. To change video titles, edit win/script.js around line 475:
   const VIDEO_TITLES = [
       "Your Custom Title 1",
       "Your Custom Title 2",
       ... etc
   ];

2. To change the site name, edit win/index.html around line 37:
   <span>VideoHub</span>  ← Change this

3. To change button text, edit win/index.html around line 44:
   <i class="fas fa-times"></i> Continue  ← Change "Continue"
